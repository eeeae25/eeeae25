# 🔧 MyImprovedStrDiffusion

> A modified and enhanced version of [StrDiffusion](https://github.com/xxx/StrDiffusion), focusing on structural guidance and improved diffusion efficiency.

## 📌 Overview

This project is based on the open-source repository **StrDiffusion**, originally proposed in the paper:
> **"Structure Matters: Tackling the Semantic Discrepancy in Diffusion Models for Image Inpainting"**  
> [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxxx) | [[Original Code]](https://github.com/xxx/StrDiffusion)

In this forked and enhanced version, I introduce several key improvements and modifications, aiming to make the model more efficient and extendable.

## 🔄 Modifications & Contributions

- ✅ Re-implemented the discriminator module for structure-texture correlation scoring.
- ✅ Integrated a **latent diffusion model** (LDM) as a replacement for the original denoising U-Net.
- ✅ Optimized training pipeline for **single-GPU 20GB A40 compatibility**.
- ✅ Cleaned and reorganized the codebase with clearer module separation.
- ✅ Added training scripts and utilities for easier configuration and reproducibility.
